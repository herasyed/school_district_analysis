# school_district_analysis

# Overview
### The students_complete.csv file that Maria gave us shows evidence of academic dishonesty. The reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders seems to have been changed. We have been asked to replace the altered scores, rerun the school district analysis and submit a write up of how the altered numbers impacted the analysis.

# Results

### We can see that the altered scores ultimately had very little impact on the district summary. The percentage of students who passed math only dropped by .2% and reading by .3%

### Similarly, the altered grades from Thomas High had no impact on passing rate of schools that spend similarly on each of their students.

### Finally, the altered scored even had a very minimal impact on Thomas High School's own passing scores.
